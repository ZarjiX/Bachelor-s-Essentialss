 The website is built for the students/job holders, who move to another city for their higher studies or jobs.
 Basically while shifting to a place that is completely unknown , students struggles a lot finding new rental
 homes. That's not the only sufferings. A student has to go through a lot of other chaos.From finding daily    
 necessary things to fixing problems that needs service of other people, the burden is huge.On the top of the
 that a student has to go through academic problems too. So the idea is to build an website that will solve all
 the household problems of a student and let student worry only about their academic problems.One site with many
 solution that will help them to settle down in a new place.Not only the app will help them in finding homes but
 for their day to day service the app will be there for them.
